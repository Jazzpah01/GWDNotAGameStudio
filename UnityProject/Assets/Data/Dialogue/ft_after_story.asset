  - isPlayer: 1
    line: You forgot the part where he helped the young stranger.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: No, I did not. I already told you. Not happening.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: "C\u2019mon old man. You know I gotta find my friend."
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Did you follow anything I said? It is a dead end, kiddo.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: 'What if it is not? I have found Tjetlik, I have found you. '
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: SO WHAT? You got lucky.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: There must be other glyphs out there.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: "DON\u2019T YOU THINK I RATHER GO BACK TO MY FAMILY, IF THERE WERE?"
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: I am sorry. Reminiscing it all got me heated.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: I know there are other glyphs out there. Kwolan got the rest.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Even if there are, I was not able to find them. What makes you think that
      you can?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: "I don\u2019t have to find them all. I can just use the ones Kwolan got
      and wait for him to appear."
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: What if he never shows up?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: '  I will wait until he does. He must be looking for me, too. '
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: He will eventually use the same glyphs that will bring him to the same
      place.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: It is not that simple. The glyphs have their own will.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: What?
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: "Remember, I tried to go back home but couldn\u2019t."
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: "Then I tried to come back here after that first time but I couldn\u2019t,
      even though I used the same pair of glyphs"
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: "You\u2019re here now. "
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: "Don\u2019t get smart with me. You already know how I got back. "
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Trial and error until I got it right. If you can call this right, that
      is.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: I can do the same.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Kwolan can do the same, I will wait.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: "You really care about this Kwolan, don\u2019t you?"
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Yes. I guess I do.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: "That settles it. I won\u2019t be able to change your mind no matter what
      I say."
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Does that mean you will help?
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: It does. Follow me.
