      go over it once again."

    line: This will make you travel somewhere not here.

    line: Patience is the key. You have to be patient.

    line: Sorry, carry on please.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: You will get lost. Frequently. That is when patience will help.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: I suggest you keep a tally of the places you have been. Try to recognise

  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Not sure, I follow.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: A pair of glyphs might not always bring you in the same place that they
      brought you before.

    line: "You\u2019ll see what I mean. Be careful. Be patient! Be aware!"
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Alas, it is time for me to part with these.
