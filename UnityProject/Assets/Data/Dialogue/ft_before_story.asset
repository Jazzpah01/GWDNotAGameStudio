    line: Wait! Tjetlik sent his greetings.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Tjetlik? That old man is still alive?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: You sound surprised.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: When someone has not returned after all these years, one can only assume
      the worst. How is he?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: The answer is not as simple as that question.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: What is that supposed to mean?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: 'Physically he seemed to be doing amazing for an old guy. '
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: But?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: And a naked one at that.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Excuse me?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: "Nothing. It is just\u2026 Tjetlik likes to go around butt-naked, having
      laughs with squirrels."
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Hahaha! That is Tjetlik, alright.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: You mean he was like that even before he left?
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Yes, he was always that fun. Is he ever coming back?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: He said he was not ready yet. Why did he leave in the first place?
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: It is a silly thing but if Tjetlik did not tell you the story, I am not
      going to either.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Speaking of stories, I heard you have quite a story, yourself.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: ' I knew you were going to ask that. The moment I saw you, I knew you came
      from that damned stone. This is a small town and everyone knows each other.'
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Let me guess, people do not like strangers around here.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Yeah, that is partially my fault too. They know about the stone because
      of me and I guess people are still sceptical after I helped Tjetlik.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Now you made me really curious about that.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Sorry kid, not my story to tell.
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Tell me yours, then.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: I will. I will. It is a long story and as you know nothing is for free.
      How about a story for another?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Oh, you want to hear mine first.
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: "That\u2019s the deal. Come, my house is this way. Feel free to start on
      the way."
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: "Alright! It all started when that idiot friend of mine came up with this
      \u201Cbrilliant\u201D plan\u2026"
  - isPlayer: 0
    line: Why does it always start with an idiot and a plan?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Does it?
  - isPlayer: 1
    line: Oh, absolutely!
